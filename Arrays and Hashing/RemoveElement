/*

Write a function that takes in two parameters: a list of numbers (nums) and a target number (val). 
The goal is to remove all occurrences of the target number from the list without creating a new list.
After the removals, the list should not have any gaps between the remaining numbers. 
The function should not return the modified list since it will be modified in place; 
however, the function should resize the list so that the remaining length matches the number of items left after the removals.

void removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
    int x = 0;
    for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
        if(nums[i]!=val){
            nums[x++] = nums[i];
        }
    }
    nums.resize(x);
 }
