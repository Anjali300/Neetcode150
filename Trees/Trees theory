##Binary Tree

- non-linear data structure
- each node can have at most two children which are referred to as the left child and the right child. 
- The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root
- the bottom-most nodes are called leaves


##Representation of Binary Tree
Each node in a Binary Tree has three parts:

- Data
- Pointer to the left child
- Pointer to the right child


##Types of Binary Tree
Binary Tree can be classified into multiples types based on multiple factors:

- On the basis of Number of Children
  -- Full Binary Tree
  -- Degenerate Binary Tree
  -- Skewed Binary Trees
- On the basis of Completion of Levels
  -- Complete Binary Tree
  -- Perfect Binary Tree
  -- Balanced Binary Tree
- On the basis of Node Values:
  -- Binary Search Tree
  -- AVL Tree
  -- Red Black Tree
  -- B Tree
  -- B+ Tree
  -- Segment Tree
